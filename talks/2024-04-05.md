A Reeb graph is a graphical representation of a scalar
function on a topological space that encodes the topology of the level
sets. Reeb graphs and their variants are popular tools in topological
data analysis and visualization. In this talk, I will discuss
theoretical advances in studying Reeb graphs and their variants, as
well as their applications in data mining and machine learning. In
particular, I will discuss novel constructions of Reeb graphs that
incorporate the use of a measure, which capture robust topology in
data. This is a joint work with Qingsong Wang, Guanqun Ma, and
Raghavendra Sridharamurthy (arXiv:2401.06748).
