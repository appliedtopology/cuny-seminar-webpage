A dialogue on avenues of exploration when leveraging TDA techniques in gene coexpression data. Topics covered will include but are not limited to gene expression level data, interpretations of covarriance in this context, and how this may inform us of genetic differences in Alzheimers patients. The majority of this conversation will be centered around what TDA experiments we've executed, what's coming down the pike, and experiment brainstorming.
