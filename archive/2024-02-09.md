Discrete structures have a long history of use in applied mathematics. Graphs and hypergraphs provide models of social networks, biological systems, academic collaborations, and much more. Network science, and more recently hypernetwork science, have been used to great effect in analyzing these types of discrete structures. Separately, the field of applied topology has gathered many successes through the development of persistent homology, mapper, sheaves, and other concepts. Recent work by our group has focused on the convergence of these two areas, developing and applying topological concepts to study discrete structures that model real data. This talk will survey our body of work in this area showing our work in both the theoretical and applied spaces. Theory topics will include an introduction to hypernetwork science and its relation to traditional network science, topological interpretations of graphs and hypergraphs, and dynamics of topology and network structures. I will show examples of how we are applying each of these concepts to real data sets.
