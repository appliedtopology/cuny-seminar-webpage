This talk gives an overview of the development of topological ideas in the context of digital sound synthesis, which is the computational generation of audio. I will discuss the topology and deformation of oscillatory algorithms, the topology of transport simulations of the 1-D wave equation, and the difficulty of constructing the analogue situation in 2-D. Finally I show how sheaves allow us to formulate classical linear time-invariant filter theory onto simplicial topologies following Robinson as well as the ability to do the same with non-linear oscillatory techniques.
