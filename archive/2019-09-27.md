Based on joint work with Sayan Mukherjee, we will talk about the need for multiple hypothesis corrections - both for Family-Wise Error Rates (decrease the risk of even a single false positive) and for False Discovery Rates (fix the rate of false positives at a chosen level) and how to correct both types in hypothesis testing using persistent homology.
