We propose a computationally efficient multiple hypothesis testing procedure for persistent homology. The computational efficiency of our procedure is based on the observation that one can empirically simulate a null distribution that is universal across many hypothesis testing applications involving persistence homology. Our observation suggests that one can simulate the null distribution efficiently based on a small number of summaries of the collected data and use this null in the same way that p-value tables were used in classical statistics. To illustrate the efficiency and utility of the null distribution we provide procedures for rejecting acyclicity with both control of the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) and the False Discovery Rate (FDR). We will argue that the empirical null we propose is very general conditional on a few summaries of the data based on simulations and limit theorems for persistent homology for point processes.
