Treewidth is an invariant of graphs which measures how close a graph 
is to being a tree.  A number of algorithms that are exponential over all 
graphs are polynomial over graphs of bounded tree width.  The treewidth of a 
3-manifold is the minimal treewidth of the dual graph of any triangulation of 
the manifold.  A number of 3-manifold invariants which are exponential in the 
number of tetrahedra are polynomial for manifolds of bounded treewidth, for 
example, the Turaev-Viro invariants. We show that for hyperbolic 3-manifolds, 
treewidth is linearly related to a metric complexity defined in terms of Morse 
functions to trees.  In particular, this shows that there are 3-manifolds of 
arbitrarily large treewidth.  This is joint work with Diane Hoffoss.
