The persistence map is the map that sends a function on a topological space to it's collection of persistence diagrams, which are canonical invariants of filtering a space by sublevel sets and taking homology in each degree. Geometrically, a persistence diagram is simply a configuration of points in the plane. In this talk I will study which configurations of points are possible and what the ramification of this map is for the simplest possible case---functions on the interval. Ongoing work and open problems will also be discussed.
