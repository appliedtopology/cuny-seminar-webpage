Discrete Morse theory is a versatile tool from combinatorial algebraic topology. In a nutshell, discrete Morse theory uses certain well-behaved functions, the so-called discrete Morse functions, from the face poset of a regular CW complex to the real numbers. Additional to providing
sublevel-filtrations, discrete Morse functions provide numerous tools to
investigate topological properties and to find theoretic guarantees for
various algorithms.

Merge trees are combinatorial descriptors for the development of path
components within different levels of filtered spaces. They have been
introduced in the context of visualization, where they are used to
approximate and compute contour trees.

In this talk, we consider an instance of an inverse problem: Given a
specific merge tree, what are all the different discrete Morse functions
on graphs that induce the given merge tree? Moreover, how can one find
all of them in structured way? This talk summarizes results from [1]
and [2].
