In this talk I will describe recent and ongoing work dedicated to developing scalable autonomous routing protocols for a future solar system wide internet. At the heart of the talk will be a description of a new coordinate system for time-varying graphs. In this new coordinate system, we can describe distances between various space networking scenarios, as well as model routing (with propagation delay) using matrix multiplication where entries are subsets of time. To demonstrate these models in practice, we use simulations of Earth-Moon-Mars systems generated in SOAP (Satellite Orbital Analysis Program) ranging from 10s to 100s of nodes in size. These simulations are part of a growing codebase being developed by SUNY Albany and NASA Glenn Research Center under the TIMAEUS project.
