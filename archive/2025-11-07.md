Topological data analysis focuses on detecting the shape of data. Motivated by problems related to training of deep learning models, we are interested in characterizing spatial interactions of two or more subsets of data. Such a task requires new tools, and we show one tool we call a mixup barcode. Based on joint work with N. Arustamyan, M. Wheeler and P. Bubenik.
