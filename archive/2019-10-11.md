Motivated by applications to topological data analysis, we give an efficient algorithm for computing a (minimal) presentation of a bigraded $K[x,y]$-module $M$, where $K$ is a field.  The algorithm takes as input a short chain complex of free modules $\displaystyle F_2\xrightarrow{\partial_2} F_1 \xrightarrow{\partial_1} F_0$ such that $M\cong \ker{\partial_1}/\im{\partial_2}$.  It runs in time $O(\sum_i |F_i|^3)$ and requires $O(\sum_i |F_i|^2)$ memory, where $|F_i|$ denotes the size of a basis of $F_i$.  We observe that, given the presentation computed by our algorithm, the bigraded Betti numbers of $M$ are readily computed.   These algorithms have been implemented in RIVET, a software tool for the visualization and analysis of two-parameter persistent homology.  In experiments on topological data analysis problems, our approach outperforms the standard computational commutative algebra packages Singular and Macaulay2 by a wide margin.
