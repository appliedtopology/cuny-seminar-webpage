It is time to kick off the Data Science and Applied Topology seminar for the fall.
This semester we will be reading the Topological Data Analysis textbook manuscript by Gunnar Carlsson, Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson and Andrew Blumberg, as well as host research talks within the topic of the seminar.

If you need a copy of the textbook, please contact Mikael Vejdemo-Johansson for details.
If you wish to give a talk, please contact any one of the organizers.
