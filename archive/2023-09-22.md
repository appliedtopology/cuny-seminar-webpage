We will watch the AATRN seminar talk "Topology of Artificial Neuron Activations in Deep Learning" by Bei Wang.

Deep convolutional neural networks such as GoogLeNet and ResNet have become ubiquitous in image classification tasks, whereas transformer-based language models such as BERT and its variants have found widespread use in natural language processing. In this talk, I will discuss recent efforts in exploring the topology of artificial neuron activations in deep learning, from images to word embeddings.
