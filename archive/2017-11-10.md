Next-generation high-throughput sequencing has generated an explosion of available genomic data. That holds a great potential for exploring biological systems with unprecedented resolution at the single-cell level. However, single-cell sequencing yields complex data output and implies technical challenges to traditional computational methods, which are mostly based on clustering and combinatorics. In this talk we will give a general perspective on the challenges and advances in the field of single-cell and associated data analysis problems. We put special emphasis on topological techniques.
