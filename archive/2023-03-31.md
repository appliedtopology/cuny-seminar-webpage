Joint work with Chad Giusti.

Plant-pollinator interactions are critical for biodiversity and agriculture. Topological techniques reveal important community information such as potential missing resources. We analyze resource complexes generated by plant-pollinator interaction data and suggest explanations for observed topological features. This research extends foundational work by Sugihara with an emphasis on topological persistence and new data.
