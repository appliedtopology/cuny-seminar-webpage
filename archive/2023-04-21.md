Persistent Homology is one of the most important techniques used in Topological Data Analysis. In the first half of the talk, we give an introduction to the subject. In the second half, we study the persistent homology output via geometric topology tools. In particular, we give a geometric description of the term “persistence”. The talk will be non-technical, and accessible to graduate students. This is a joint work with Henry Adams.
