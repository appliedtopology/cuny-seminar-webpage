It's fun to think of good generative patterns and mathematical visualizations for low resolution spaces like knitting. Come hear about the interesting mathematics of what is possible on industrial knitting machines. Learn about skew, pixel resolution constraints, stitch direction, and types of knitting. Find out about some recent research and what it means to mathematical knitting.
