All of the nouns in the title will be defined.  The Vietoris-Rips complex of a hypercube graph is 
a natural object that arises in coding theory.    There are two integer parameters:  n â€“ the size of the hypercube
 and r- the scaling distance.  There are recent results by Adams et-al describing their topology.  
For example, the Vietoris-Rips complex for the n-dimensional hypercube at scale 2 is a wedge (bouquet) of 
3 dimensional spheres.   The methods used are geometric.  I will describe an algebraic approach for computing 
the cohomology of the Vietoris-Rips complex.
