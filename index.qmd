title: "Data Science and Applied Topology Seminar"
---

The CUNY Data Science and Applied Topology Reading Group is joint between the Mathematics and Computer Science programmes. We meet Fridays 11.45 -- 12.45 in GC 4321. You can contact us at [cunygc@appliedtopology.nyc](cunygc@appliedtopology.nyc).

Our plan is to primarily read and discuss seminal papers in data science, in applied topology and in topological data analysis. Each seminar one participant takes the responsibility to present a paper and prepare items for discussion. We expect occasionally to be able to invite external speakers.
